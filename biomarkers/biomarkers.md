# Tuberculosis Biomarkers  

Discovered in 19th century, [Tuberculosis (TB)](http://www.who.int/tb/en/) is still a serious public health problem and it is estimated that one third of the World’s population is infected with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (mTB). A biomarker is defined as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal or pathological processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention [(“Biomarkers and Surrogate Endpoints: 2001”)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11240971) which can be used for prediction, diagnosis, staging and monitoring prognosis of a disease. The two data sets we use for this workflow can be found using their NCBI database ids [GSE19491](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19491) and [GSE37250](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37250).  
  
The workflow is organized in steps:  
1. [Training data preparation.](GSE37250.md)
2. [Test data preparation.](GSE19491.md)
